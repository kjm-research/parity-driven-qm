1. **Prof. Selim Jochim** -- Heidelberg University (BEST FIT -- has deterministic few-fermion preparation)
   - Email: selim.jochim@physi.uni-heidelberg.de
   - Why: Already prepares exact-number fermion systems (2, 6, 12 atoms). Has the apparatus to do this experiment now.

2. **Prof. Markus Greiner** -- Harvard University
   - Email: greiner@physics.harvard.edu
   - Why: Built the quantum gas microscope. Parity projection is already part of their imaging. Optical lattice Mott insulator gives exact occupation control.

3. **Prof. Immanuel Bloch** -- MPQ Munich

## Email Body

Dear Prof. [NAME],

I am writing to propose a specific experiment that your group is uniquely positioned to perform, testing a prediction from a new quantum mechanics framework I have developed.

**The prediction:** Systems with an even number of fermions maintain quantum coherence longer than systems with an odd number, by a ratio of exp(Delta_E / kT), where Delta_E is a parity energy gap on the order of 10^-6 to 10^-3 eV. This even/odd oscillation in decoherence rate has never been tested as a controlled variable.

**The experiment:**
1. Prepare a trap with exactly N fermions (your group has demonstrated this capability)
2. Measure coherence time (Ramsey interferometry or Loschmidt echo)
3. Repeat with N+1 fermions under identical conditions
4. Compare coherence times across a range of N values (e.g., N = 2 through 12)
5. Look for a sawtooth pattern: even-N systems consistently more coherent than odd-N

**Why this matters:** This test discriminates between my framework (parity-driven quantum mechanics) and standard decoherence theory, which predicts no even/odd dependence. Krapivsky, Luck, and Mallick (2018, J. Stat. Mech. 023104) independently predicted that the quantum return probability for N lattice fermions behaves qualitatively differently for even vs. odd N, but this has never been experimentally tested.

[LAB-SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH -- see below]

The full theoretical framework, mathematical formalism (Lagrangian, equations of motion, exact solutions), and numerical validation are available at:

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further. The experiment requires no new apparatus -- only a systematic coherence measurement across consecutive particle numbers, which your group already has the tools to perform.

## Lab-Specific Paragraphs

### For Jochim (Heidelberg):
Your group's work on deterministic few-fermion preparation (Bayha, Holten et al., Nature 2020; Holten et al., Nature 2022) demonstrates the exact capability needed. You have prepared closed-shell configurations of 2, 6, and 12 Li-6 atoms with full particle-number control. Extending your measurement protocol to include coherence times across consecutive N values (e.g., N = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) would directly test the even/odd prediction. The pairing signatures you have already observed in these systems are consistent with the framework's predictions about even-parity stability.

### For Greiner (Harvard):
Your quantum gas microscope provides single-site, single-atom resolution in optical lattices. In the Mott insulator regime, you achieve exact occupation numbers per site (n=1 or n=2). Comparing coherence properties of n=1 (odd) vs n=2 (even) occupied sites, or of small clusters with controlled total atom number, would test the even/odd prediction. The parity projection inherent in your fluorescence imaging is itself a signature of the even/odd physics this framework addresses.

### For Bloch (MPQ):
Your group's observation of brane parity order in the Mott insulator (Phys. Rev. X 13, 021042, 2023) is directly relevant. You are already measuring nonlocal parity correlations across extended regions. The prediction here is more specific: that the coherence time of a region depends on whether its total atom number is even or odd, not just its parity correlation structure. Your programmable optical lattice platform could test this by comparing coherence decay rates in regions with controlled even vs. odd total occupation.
